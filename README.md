## Research *(Approx. 20-30% of word count)*

### What sources or references have you identified as relevant to this task?

Reflect on the **type** and **relevance** of sources explored. Justify your research direction in relation to the task brief and target outcomes.

* What types of sources did you explore and why?
* Which types of sources did you avoid and why?
* How does the research relate to the user experience, technical approach, or creative aim?

### Sources

For each source, provide:

1. An **opening paragraph** describing the source's creator/publisher, reputation, and relevance.
2. A **bullet list** of what you analysed or learned from it.
3. A **closing paragraph** evaluating its usefulness or limitations.

You may include both **academic resources** and **industry examples** (e.g. documentation, games, developer talks). You are encouraged to include plenty of images, videos and diagrams.

> You should have at least 1 game source as inspiration, 1 documentation/tutorial source and 1 academic source at a minimum.

## Declared Assets

You must declare any content that was **not entirely created by you**, or was **modified with the aid of AI tools**. This includes:

* Third-party 3D models, audio, textures, or code
* Code snippets from tutorials or forums
* AI-generated or AI-assisted assets (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, DALL·E)

List these clearly, with context where needed.

Example:

> The following assets were created or modified with the use of GPT-4o:

## Tips for Success

* Use plenty of **images, code snippets, drawn diagrams, tables and embedded media** to support your writing.
* Use **inline citations** for everything that influenced your work, including software and games. Include as many **hyperlinks** as possible for easier navigation to external sources.
* Reference **documentation, tutorials**, and **games** just like academic sources.
* Word count is a guideline – ±10% is allowed.
* You are allowed to use AI tools, but you **must declare** them under *Declared Assets*.
